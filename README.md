Application (screen mode) is created for Waveshare 7.5inch E-Ink (800Ã—480) display.

### .env file
Some data (e.g. API key) needs to be stored in `.env` file.
```
API_KEY=<your-open-weather-API-key>
```

## Usage
It can be used in two modes:
- screen mode with RaspberryPi and e-Paper screen, 
- test mode (save image on the local disk and show it).

### Windows (only test mode)
1. Clone repository by "git clone https://github.com/todr93/WeatherStation".
1. Use "createEnvironment.bat" to create virtual environment and install all required modules.
1. Use "runTestMode.bat" to run application in test mode.

### Linux (test mode)
1. Clone repository by "git clone https://github.com/todr93/WeatherStation".
1. Make scripts executables:  
    - "chmod +x createEnvironment.sh",
    - "chmod +x runTestMode.sh".
1. Use "createEnvironment.sh" to create virtual environment and install all required modules.
1. Use "runTestMode.sh" to run application in test mode.

### Linux - RaspberryPi (screen mode)
1. Clone repository by "git clone https://github.com/todr93/WeatherStation".
1. Make scripts executables:  
    - "chmod +x createEnvironmentRasp.sh",
    - "chmod +x runScreenMode.sh".
